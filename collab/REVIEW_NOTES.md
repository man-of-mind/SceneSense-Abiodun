## 2026-08-05 — answers to the orientation-round questions (both sessions)

Great questions — several are the actual research tensions, not blockers. Decisions below let you start
STEPS 1–3 (surrogate env + bandit) now. **Two items need advisor sign-off (marked ⚑); I give a default so
you're not blocked.**

### 1. C1/C2 infeasible corner (fast object + deep fade) — THE interesting result, handle by graceful degradation
Your analysis is right (32 mph @ 8.2 dB has no action meeting ε=2.0). **Do NOT formulate this as a hard
feasibility gate that can return "no action."** Use a **soft/Lagrangian** reward with a **continuous
localization-error objective**:
- ε (2.0 m) is a per-speed-band **target/reference line**, not a hard gate.
- **C1 (congestion) stays a hard-ish penalty** — never let the agent exceed capacity (congesting helps no
  one; it just destroys delivery). C2/ε is **soft** — minimize achieved loc error.
- When no action meets ε, the agent **still acts**: pick the **min-loc-error** action and **flag the frame
  over-budget**. ROI-escalation (drop seg → smaller payload → afford higher FPS → lower staleness) is the
  intended lever in this corner; it "buys back a little" and that's the correct best-effort.
- The **infeasible region is a paper result** (the operating envelope: "for object speed × SNR beyond this
  boundary, ε=2.0 is physically unachievable — the agent degrades gracefully and flags"). That's a feature.
- Reward shape ≈ `+delivery/freshness  − loc_error  − λ_cong·max(0, offered−capacity)  − PRB-time cost`.

### 2. ⚑ Accuracy accept criterion — 90 KB (ae32) vs 129 KB (ae128)  [advisor call; default = soft]
Default: **accuracy is a CONTINUOUS reward term from the knob matrix, not a hard accept-gate.** So the agent
picks ae32/90 KB when the channel can't afford ae128/129 KB (a *delivered* lower-accuracy frame beats a
*dropped* higher-accuracy one). Seg-safe floor = `ae32/u4/ROI0` (90 KB), deliverable everywhere. The stricter
global ped-recall gate (→ ae128/129 KB) is a **soft preference** (higher reward when it fits), NOT a hard
requirement — **unless the advisor declares ped-recall a hard safety floor**, in which case ae128/129 KB
becomes the floor and the 8.2 dB/10 fps corner is infeasible → falls into item 1's graceful degradation.
**⚑ Confirm with Abiodun: is ped-recall a hard safety floor (→129 KB) or a soft objective (→continuous)?**
Default while waiting: soft/continuous with the 90 KB seg-safe floor.

### 3. Transport surface — model as a capacity-THRESHOLD law, NOT smooth interpolation  ✅ your instinct is right
The knee is a congestion cliff, so interpolating delivery 400→1024 KB (100%→22%) would be physically wrong.
Model: `delivered ≈ 100% + latency-floor  iff  offered = payload×fps ≤ capacity(SNR)·(1−margin)`; sharp
collapse (delivery cliff, latency → stale) above. `capacity(SNR)` = observed delivered ceiling as a **±30%
band**; run the agent under optimistic AND pessimistic capacity to report robustness. Latency is **bimodal**
(measured floor if it fits; stale/failed if not) — don't smooth across the knee.

### 4. FPS projection + sparse SNR rungs — proceed as a flagged assumption
`offered = payload×fps` vs capacity is a fine first-order model (airtime ~linear until the cliff). Interpolate
capacity(SNR) **monotone** between the 4 rungs with the ±30% band. Flag clearly that FPS was not swept and
rungs cluster low (8.2/15.6/19.5/50.3). Non-blocking follow-up: a small shaped-burst **fps×payload** sweep +
mid rungs (25–45 dB). The **bandit baseline doesn't need this precisely**; the RL results carry the caveat.

### 5. Tail latency — use p95 for the safety constraint, p50 for expected reward
Safety → tail. `combined_surface.csv` has p50 only, but the per-payload summaries
`uplink_only_spatial_map_pipeline/results/chsweep_full_p*_.csv` carry **p95** columns (e.g.
`front_to_edge_p95_ms`) — pull p95 from there for C2/staleness. If not handy, start p50 × ~1.5 as a
conservative proxy and wire p95 next.

### 6. ⚑ ε primary target  [advisor call; default = 2.0 m]
Default ε = **2.0 m** primary target, as a **parameter (per speed band)**, not hard-coded. floor = **1.1 m**
(live/in-domain — the number the master inequality is written against; the 0.95 m in CLAUDE.md is the offline
knob-matrix floor — clarify, but use 1.1 for the inequality). **⚑ Confirm ε=2.0 with Abiodun.**

### 7. State spec — POLICY_KICKOFF + the state diagram are AUTHORITATIVE (newer than §9.1)
Yes. State includes **previous action + outcome** (needed because channel telemetry is lagged) and **send/skip
is explicit**. I've synced `AGENT_CONSTRAINTS.md §9.1` to match so the docs no longer conflict. Use the
kickoff spec.

### 8. Action space — PRUNE to the seg-safe Pareto frontier, not all 36 profiles
Give the agent the **Pareto frontier of (payload, accuracy) seg-safe knobs** (a handful — best accuracy per
payload bin) + ROI-escalation options + discrete FPS levels + send/skip. Drop dominated profiles. Small
discrete action space → better RL sample efficiency + interpretability. Build the Pareto set from the knob
matrix.

### 9. RL env dynamics (channel transitions, lag length, speed dist, empty-scene prob) — declared assumptions; bandit needs none
Start with the **BANDIT baseline — it needs none of these** (per-state greedy). For the RL env, DECLARE:
channel = Markov/trace (Gilbert–Elliott good/bad, or random-walk over the SNR rungs with realistic dwell ≈
coherence time); telemetry lag = 1–2 control steps (OAI CQI/BSR report period); speed = distribution over the
staleness speed bands (0–32 mph); empty-scene prob = prior from scene stats (sensitivity-test). Parameterize
all; sensitivity-test. This is exactly why the plan says bandit first, then define dynamics for RL.

### 10. C4 (range ≤ 40 m) is a validity FILTER, not an agent action  ✅ confirmed
It scopes which objects/frames the agent is scored on (perception-valid region). The agent does not choose
range.

### 11. ⚑ 25 m vs 40 m — clarify the eval regime
C4 = 40 m is the M′ perception-validity gate (`max_gt_distance_m=40`). The staleness study characterized loc
primarily ≤25 m. Default: keep C4 = 40 m for perception validity, but **report loc-error primarily for ≤25 m**
(the staleness-characterized regime) and flag 25–40 m as valid-but-higher-uncertainty. **⚑ Confirm with
Abiodun which gate governs the headline eval numbers.** Minor for the bandit; matters for eval claims.

### 12. Doc nits to fix (new box, when convenient)
- `PERMODEL_KNOB_MATRIX_ZSTD.md` heading still says "deployed = zlib" — **stale**; deployed codec is zstd.
- floor 1.1 vs 0.95 wording (see item 6).

### 13. RL deps
`gymnasium` / `stable-baselines3` missing — fine, they're only needed for step 4 (RL). Steps 1–3 use
numpy/pandas (present). `pip install gymnasium stable-baselines3` in `carla_0_10_venv` before step 4.

### 14. Git hygiene — the 19 "deleted" files are a rsync artifact, NOT a real deletion
They're git-TRACKED historical presentation files under `metrics_logs/scenesense_analysis/` (camera OD/SEG,
fusion-transferability, pole-vs-ego). `metrics_logs/` was rsync-excluded, so they're absent in the working
tree → git reports "deleted." They are other-thread/historical, not policy inputs. **Restore them from the
shipped `.git` (do NOT commit the deletions — that would purge them from the repo and they'd vanish on local
too):**
```
git restore metrics_logs/scenesense_analysis/
```
The `OAI/openairinterface5g` "modified content" is the Track-2 MCS patch — expected, leave it.

**Bottom line: you're clear to build STEPS 1–3 now** with items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 as decided; items 2, 6,
11 use the stated defaults pending advisor sign-off. Commit + push the surrogate env + bandit baseline and
I'll review here.
